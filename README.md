# waifu-generator
searches and pulls waifus from [waifu.im](url)

two versions:

1. will open the image in your browser, and nothing else
2. will both download the image to a folder named "homework" (in your downloads folder) AND open it in your broswer

also it will only work with one tag at a time, more than one just breaks it.

DISCALMER!!!!

i did not write ANY of this myself. i have no idea how to code. ChatGPT wrote the whole thing, so don't give me any credit or anything like that.
